          <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="list-home" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-home-list">Very few villains can say that they are so bad they’ve been banned from hell. Harley Quinn is one of these few villains.

            Both comic book villains and heroes alike tend to die… a lot. (Don’t worry, they always come back.) When Harley Quinn died, she found herself in hell, because duh. Her experience in hell played out in Harley Quinn #20-22. Like any hellish storyline, Harley had to endure specific types of torture. In this version of hell, Harley has to battle a S.W.A.T. team over and over again. Yes, it’s on loop for all of time. Harley unleashes her usual crazy (but fun) antics on the S.W.A.T. team and the bounty hunter who is to kill anyone who tries to escape. It’s then that the demons are so put off by her love for them – yes, her love for them – that they banish her from hell.
            
            Don’t forget, Harley only loves the baddest of the bad, so obviously her love for these hellish demons isn't all that surprising. The fact that she was kicked out of hell, though - that's pretty dark.</div>
          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-profile" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-profile-list">Some versions of Harley Quinn are much crazier than others. The version of Harley Quinn in the animated miniseries Gods and Monsters is definitely one of those "much crazier than others" versions. In fact, it's a mega dark take on the character.

            This Harley Quinn rocks an even more risqué outfit than usual. I’m sure the men around the world probably wouldn't mind seeing Margot Robbie in this Harley Quinn costume for the solo film. However, they probably wouldn’t be too down with this take on Harley Quinn. This Harley hangs out in an abandoned warehouse, where she has a collection of body parts - like a legit serial killer. She’s collected these dead body parts and started to put together her “family”. In the showdown scene, Harley accidentally decapitates her “grandma” who is not technically her grandma but just a random body. It’s still pretty insane, though.</div>
          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-messages" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-messages-list">Harley Quinn is in to some perverse foreplay, guys.

            In Suicide Squad #7, Harley Quinn was part of the Suicide Squad. While she was starting to fight for the "good" guys and turn a new leaf, she was still desperately in love with her puddin'. Upon learning of the Joker’s disappearance, Harley gets arrested... on purpose. You see, she wanted to get into the Police Department because that’s where the Joker’s face was. Yes, he ditched his own face before he disappeared. Villain stuff, right?
            
            She takes the Joker's face and also captures Deadshot. Having Deadshot tied to a chair, Harley then places the Joker’s face on top of his face. She precedes to straddle Deadshot and call him Mister J. It’s beyond weird, but also an iconic scene at this point. With this love triangle having been hinted at in 2016’s Suicide Squad, we wonder if Will Smith will have to rock Jared Leto’s Joker face in the near future. Though, this may be a plot too dark to actually make it to be big screen.</div>
          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-settings" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-settings-list">If there wasn't enough proof that the Joker's relationship with Harley Quinn is toxic then their wedding in Injustice is the ultimate evidence of their dysfunction. In the video game and alternate comic book series, Harley Quinn gets married to him only to snap after the Clown Prince smears wedding cake on her face, killing her husband by cutting his throat.

            Harley has been pushed to her breaking point and beyond by the Joker over the years. This final violent act is an appropriate culmination of their twisted 'romance.'</div>
